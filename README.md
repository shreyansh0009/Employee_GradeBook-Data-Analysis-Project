# Employee_GradeBook-Data-Analysis-Project

Hey this is Saurabh, I made this project named "Employee Gradebook". There are various thing in this project, I'll explane you briefly:
> There is multiple columns of ratings of employees such as: communication skills, eficiency, hobbies etc.
> There are maximum ten(10) points for each column.
> Each column has an colured Indicator which is associated with each employees. eg. green: excellent, yellow: good, orange: ok, red: ---
> So this project determines you should keep employees in your firm or not.
> There is also a column which sugests: you should fire this employee or not according to calculation of his/her various ratings.

- Thankyou!
